Dijkstra's and Reliagble Shortest Path algorithms

The program will run Dijkstra's and Reliable Shortest Path's (RSP) on a graph read in from an input file.

To run simply type 'make' then 'a.out <filename>' where filename is a file with one comment line (#) at the top, then 'D' or 'UD' on the next line specifying a directed or undirected graph.

Then each line has an edge with weight in format "v1 v2 weight". 

IMPORTANT: program only works when vertices are characters (ie. A, B, C) not integers. This is in accordance with the sample input example formats found on blackboard.

You will then have to input the source vertex (a char) for Dijkstra's and a source vertex and max edges 'k' for the RSP algorithm.
